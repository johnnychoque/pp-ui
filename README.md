# Participant Portal

Using this UI the participant can manage several options to take part of the experiments. The participant could receive invitations sending by experimenter to encourage to enroll in their experiments. The participant can also take the initiative to register in the public experiments without needing to receive a previous invitation.

You need git to clone the repository. You can get git from
[http://git-scm.com/](http://git-scm.com/).

We also use a number of node.js tools to initialize and test the Web App. You must have node.js and
its package manager (npm) installed. You can get them from [http://nodejs.org/](http://nodejs.org/).

Also gulp: `npm install -g gulp` (with `sudo` if you are using Mac).

### Clone the project

Clone the repository using:

```
git clone git@gitlab.tlmat.unican.es:jchoque/pp-ui-new.git
